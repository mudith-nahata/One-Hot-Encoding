**One-Hot-Encoding**

--> One Hot Encoding is a technique used to apply in  a categorical data.

--> where the each data in the string can be encoded as numericals, so that it can be easily trained by the ML Model.

--> whenever we use one hot encoding tecgnique then , the output will be based on the number of categories in the input column.

--> and also this technique will not be efficient in linear algorithms

                  . Linear Regression

                  . Logistic regression

--> so whenver we calculate the sum for each row the output will be one, so we need to drop the first column on every encoded data.

--> or else we get the problem of multicollinearity.

--> every single columns is considered as dummy variable in the encoded data.

--> so whenver we are going to perform one hot encoding it should be N-1 columns based on the categories of the input data.

--> Due to Multicollinearity of droping the columns is called as dummy variable trap
